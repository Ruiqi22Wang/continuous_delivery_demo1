# continuous_delivery_demo1
This repo is connected to my Google App Engine application built on GCP Cloud Shell environment. In order to create an app like this, go the your GCP console and create a new project, then connect it to your own GitHub repo (like this one). Then you can design your app based on whatever you want to demonstrate thru the app. The simplest infrastructure for an app like mine are some yaml files and some .py files. The yams file are to specify the language version and steps. In my main.py i use flask to design my website. After pushing the code you can then deploy and browse your app!
